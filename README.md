Run "npm i" to install dependences.

Create a ".env" file.

Create a "PORT" constant in the ".env" file and set its value to "8000" or any port of choice.

Create a "DATABASE_URL" constant in the ".env" file and set its value to your MongoDB database URL.

Change MongoDB database URL to yours in "index.js".

Uncomment any function you wish to test out in "index.js".

Run "npm run dev" to start Express server and see the magic.

Happy Coding!!!
